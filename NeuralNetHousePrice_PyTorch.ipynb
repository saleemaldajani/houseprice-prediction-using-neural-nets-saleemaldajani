    "# House Price Prediction Using PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds a neural network using PyTorch to predict house prices. It closely follows a Keras/TensorFlow version but is implemented in PyTorch. The dataset is split into 80% training and 20% validation (from `train.csv`), and a final prediction is made on `test.csv` with the results saved as `predictions.csv`.\n",

    "### How Many Nodes Should You Put?\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no fixed rule for determining the exact number of nodes in each hidden layer. A common strategy is to start with a reasonably large number and then gradually reduce it in subsequent layers. In this example, we use **128 nodes in the first hidden layer** and **64 nodes in the second layer** as a baseline. These values are chosen based on the dataset size and complexity. You should perform hyperparameter tuning (e.g., using cross-validation) to explore if a different architecture (more or fewer nodes/layers) improves performance."
